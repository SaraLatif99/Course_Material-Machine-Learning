Useful for predicting categories with two classes.

SVM: 
- greater than 100 features, linear model

averaged perceptron: 
- Fast training, linear model

logistic regression: 
- Fast training, linear model

Bayes point machine: 
- Fast training, linear model

decision forest: 
- Accuracy, fast training

boosted decision tree: 
- Accuracy, fast training, large memory footprint

decision jungle: 
- accuracy, small memory footprint

locally deep SVM: 
- greater than 100 features

nueral network: 
- accuracy, long training times
